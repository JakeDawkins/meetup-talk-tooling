## What I'm Talking About

- The promise of GraphQL
- The state of GraphQL tooling
- A modern tooling setup
- Where we're going

---

# The Promise of GraphQL

---

## The promise of GraphQL

> A GraphQL server can be queried for the types it supports. This creates a powerful platform for tools and client software to build atop this information...

```notes
GraphQL was designed with the intent to leverage its schema
```

---

export default Invert;

# Schema Awareness

---

## Schema Awareness Enables...

- Code generation
- Editor improvements

---

export default Invert;

# Schema Registries

---

## Registries Enable...

- Advanced usage metrics
- Schema change validation
- Operation safelisting
- And much more

---

export default Invert;

# The state of GraphQL tooling

---

> The tooling ecosystem around GraphQL is powerful, capable, but disconnected and not complete.

---

## Code Generators

- Apollo Codegen (Apollo CLI)
- GraphQL Code Generator

---

## Editor plug-ins (js)

- Apollo GraphQL
- Graphql

---

## Introspection/Runtime Tooling

- GraphiQL/GraphQL Playground
- Apollo Client Devtools
- GraphQL Voyager

---

> Toolsets are best when they can be configured in unison and work with one another

---

## Configuring GraphQL tools

- Where does the reference schema info come from?
- Where do queries and type definitions come from?
- Handling multiple projects, including ones that share schemas or operations
- Platform-specific concerns (Registry endpoints, API keys, reporting URLs)

export default Invert;

# A modern tooling setup

---

## A modern tooling setup...

- Tracks schemas in a registry
- Checks service schema changes against traffic
- Safelists permitted operations in production
- Generates types for client operations
- Checks client operation changes against the schema

---

export default Invert;

# Where we're going

---

## Where we're going

- Generating new projects from the CLI
- Schema explorer link to schema registry
- Ability to save operations and generate hooks and types
